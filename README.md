# Download

C3PM is current in alpha. For now there's only a build for windows OS. You can download it [at the C3PM official page](https://relixes.itch.io/).

If you're not on windows, you can still run the project installing [python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) into your machine and running the main.py file.
